That's great to hear, Mark! It sounds like you've found a really positive and enjoyable work environment. It's always a bonus when your coworkers are friendly and helpful, and having a flexible boss can make a big difference in work-life balance. Being able to make your own hours and have a relaxed dress code definitely adds to the appeal. It's interesting to hear how you prefer to finish early and enjoy the morning, while your friend prefers to sleep in and is more alert in the evenings.
